    "We want to look at the change in population per age group, as well as share of total population per age group, between the two five year periods represented by the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. Here that's 2010-2014, and 2015-2019. We're going to bring in the 2014 file and rename the columns so that it's clear which is the older set - but I'm not going to specify the year so that this code can be reused with minimal changes when the next 5 year estimates come out. I'm going to bring in the 2019 shapefile so that we can map it and we already have a geodataframe. Make sure to reproduce that shapefile in the 2019 CBSA prep notebook because these are regularly deleted for memory purposes."
